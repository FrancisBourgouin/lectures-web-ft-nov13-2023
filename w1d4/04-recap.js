// Understand the concept of what is an higher order function?

// Understand a Callback function?

// Functions => DRY code, better readability
// We need parameters for our functions

// If a function is super generic
// Then maybe it's time to have a parameter that will be a function

// Make sure to look at MDN for array methods or other methods before building your own.
